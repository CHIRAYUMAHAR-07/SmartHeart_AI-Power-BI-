# SmartHeart AI: Predictive Analytics for Cardiovascular Health Using BRFSS 2020

# Project Overview : 
This Power BI dashboard presents a comprehensive and data-driven exploration of cardiovascular health trends using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2020 dataset. The project, titled SmartHeart AI, leverages advanced analytics and interactive visualizations to uncover patterns, disparities, and predictive insights related to heart health across diverse demographic and behavioral dimensions.

# Objectives : 
Analyze cardiovascular disease prevalence across race, gender, and age groups.
Examine correlations between lifestyle factors (alcohol, physical activity, smoking) and heart health.
Identify high-risk populations and potential intervention points.
Provide actionable insights for healthcare professionals and policymakers.

# Dashboard Components & Insights

Demographic & Behavioral Trends : 
Racial Trends in Wellness & Drinking: A bar chart visualizes alcohol consumption patterns across racial groups (White, Hispanic, Black, Asian, American Indian, Other), highlighting disparities in lifestyle choices.
Asthma Cases by Race & Gender: A line chart reveals how asthma prevalence varies across racial and gender segments, offering clues about environmental and genetic factors.

General Health & Lifestyle Correlations : 
General Health Breakdown by Sleep & Age: A pie chart categorizes health status (Excellent to Poor) across age groups, emphasizing the role of sleep and aging in overall wellness.
Physical Activity vs. Asthma Incidence by Race: A comparative bar chart shows how physical activity impacts asthma rates across racial groups, suggesting preventive strategies.

Cardiovascular Disease Classification
Types of Cardiovascular Diseases: A flowchart categorizes heart conditions into Congenital, Cardiomyopathy, Myocarditis, Ischemic, and Rheumatic, aiding clinical understanding.
Categories of Heart Diseases: Another flowchart breaks down broader categories like Coronary HD, Cardiovascular HD, and Other HD into subtypes for granular analysis.

Health Status & Risk Factors
Health Status by Gender, Stroke History & Mobility: A bar chart compares health outcomes for individuals with stroke and mobility issues, segmented by gender.
Mental Health & Mobility by Gender and Smoking Status: A pie chart highlights how smoking and gender influence mental health and mobility challenges.

Advanced Anatomical & Functional Insights
Heart Anatomy and Function: An anatomical illustration educates viewers on heart structure, including valves and cellular function, bridging data with biology.

Predictive & Strategic Metrics
Model Deployment Readiness: A gauge indicator reflects the AI modelâ€™s readiness for deployment based on accuracy and performance.
Cost-Benefit Analysis & ROI Projection: Bar and pie charts estimate the financial impact of AI-driven interventions compared to manual processes.
